# WebApplication: This is my first web application using python. In this, I used PyWebIO, and wanted to create a simple money calculator to determine how much money you were saving overall within the year. The progam will ask the user to input their yearly income before taxes, then how much expenses are per month. I took an average of taxes that are taken out per year (about 30%) and used this for my calculations. Based on the information given, it will give you the percentage of how much money you saved.
